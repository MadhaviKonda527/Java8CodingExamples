Q1. Can we define static variables inside the static method or not? 
Ans: No, Static applies to the class level not a method level,If we define a varible inside method can be treated as local.
If you want to share a varible across all the instance and accessible without creating object, declare it as static variable within class defination 
,outside of any method.
Q2. In project when we will instance & static varaibles give the scenario? 
Q3. When we will use for vs. for-each? 
Use for loops when:
You need more control over the loop iteration. 
This includes:
Knowing the exact number of iterations beforehand: 
You can define a counter variable and loop until a specific condition is met.
Modifying the loop counter: You can increment/decrement the counter by different values or even skip iterations entirely.
Needing the loop index: You can access the current index within the loop using the counter variable.
Breaking out of the loop early: You can use break to exit the loop prematurely based on certain conditions.
Looping backwards: You can easily iterate through a collection in reverse order using a for loop.
Performance is critical: In some cases, for loops might be slightly faster than for-each loops, especially for simple iterations.

Use for-each loops when:
You simply want to iterate over a collection and perform an action on each element.
The order of iteration doesn't matter.
You don't need the loop index.
Your code readability is prioritized. for-each loops can often be more concise and easier to understand.

Q4. Define JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
The foundation, a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode (not machine-specific code).
It interprets bytecode and translates it into instructions for the underlying system. 
This allows Java programs to run on any platform with a JVM implementation.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): 
Essential for running Java programs. 
It includes the JVM, along with core libraries for common tasks (I/O, networking, GUI) and sometimes a launcher tool. 
The JRE is for users who execute Java applications, not develop them.
JDK (Java Development Kit): 
A superset of the JRE. It provides everything in the JRE, plus a comprehensive set of development tools for creating Java applications: 
compiler (javac), archiver (jar), debugger (jdb), and documentation tool (Javadoc). 
The JDK is crucial for developers who want to build Java programs.
Analogy:
JVM: Engine (core functionality)
JRE: The Car (includes engine and essential components to run)
JDK: Mechanic's Toolkit (all the tools to build, maintain, and repair the car)
Key Responsibilities: The JVM is responsible for:
Loading bytecode into memory.
Managing memory allocation and garbage collection.
Executing bytecode instructions.
Providing security features like sandboxing.

Q5. How many parts of java?
For running Java programs, you need both the JVM and the JRE.
Depending on your development needs, you might choose Java SE or Java EE.
These are the core components, but the Java ecosystem also includes various development tools,
frameworks, and libraries that extend its capabilities.

Q6. What is the purpose of methods? 
Methods are fundamental building blocks in Java that offer numerous benefits for effective programming:
Reusability
Modularity
Readability
Encapsulation
Logic Abstraction

Q7. Define class vs.Object?
Class: A class acts as a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of similar objects. 
It's a reusable specification that encapsulates what an object of that kind will be like.  
Imagine a class as an architect's detailed plan for a house.

Object: An object is an instance of a class.
It's a concrete entity that represents a real-world thing with specific attributes and behaviors defined by the class.  
Think of an object as an actual house built based on the architect's plan. 
There can be many houses (objects) built from the same blueprint (class).

Q8. Define and(&),or(|)?
In Java, & and | are used for bitwise and logical operations, respectively. 
They operate on individual bits within integers. Here's a breakdown of each:
int a = 6 (binary: 0110);
int b = 5 (binary: 0101);
int c = a & b;  // c will be 4 (binary: 0100)
int c = a | b;  // c will be 7 (binary: 0111)

Q9. Define the constructor?
a constructor is a special type of method that is invoked when an object of a class is created.
Object Initialization: The constructor is responsible for initializing the instance variables (member variables) of an object with starting values. 
This ensures that the object is in a usable state as soon as it's created.
Memory Allocation: When you create an object using the new keyword, memory is allocated for the object.
The constructor can perform any necessary setup tasks within this allocated memory.
Same Name as Class:
No Return Type:
Implicit Constructor:
No-argument Constructor:
Parameterized Constructor:

Q10. define break vs. continue? 
break:
Terminates the loop immediately.
Once break is encountered within a loop (for, while, do-while),
the loop completely stops execution, and control jumps to the statement after the loop.

continue:
Skips the current iteration of the loop and continues to the next iteration.
The remaining code within the current iteration is not executed after encountering continue.
It's often used when you want to skip specific conditions within a loop iteration but still continue looping through the remaining elements.

break exits the entire loop.
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
Both break and continue can be used within for, while, and do-while loops.
It's often used when you want to exit the loop prematurely based on a certain condition.

Q11.  Define the package in java? 
a package is a fundamental way to organize classes, interfaces, and other entities. 
It provides a hierarchical namespace structure for your code, offering several benefits:
Improved Organization:
Reduced Naming Conflicts:
Accessibility Control: (public,private)
com.example.myproject.utils
In this example:
com is a common top-level domain for organizations.
example is a company or organization name.
myproject is the specific project name.
utils is a sub-package containing utility classes.

Q12. What is the difference between bitwise & logical operator? 
Bitwise AND (&):
Operates on individual bits within integers (data types like int, byte, short).
Compares the corresponding bits of the operands (numbers) at the binary level.
The result at each bit position is 1 only if both operands have a 1 in that position. Otherwise, the result is 0.

Logical AND (&&):
Operates on boolean values (true or false).
Evaluates both operands from left to right.
The result is true only if both operands are true.
If the first operand is false, the second operand is not even evaluated (short-circuit evaluation).

Q13. What are the entry controlled loop & exit controll loop? 
1. Entry Controlled Loops:
The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
The loop body only executes if the condition evaluates to true.
If the condition is initially false, the loop body won't execute at all.
Examples: for, while loops.

2. Exit Controlled Loops:
The condition is evaluated after each iteration of the loop.
The loop body executes at least once, regardless of the initial condition.
The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition remains true.
Example: do-while loop.

Q14. When we will get StackOverflowError?
StackOverflowError indicates a problem with your program's logic, typically related to uncontrolled recursion or excessive method call depth.
By understanding its causes and implementing proper termination conditions, you can prevent this error and ensure your Java programs run smoothly.

Q15. Explain instance & static blocks? What is the purpose of blocks? 
Instance Blocks (Initializer Blocks):
Executed every time an object of the class is created.
Used to initialize instance variables (member variables) of an object with specific values before the constructor is called.
Can be multiple instance blocks within a class, and they are executed in the order they appear in the code.

Static Blocks:
Executed only once, the first time the class is loaded into memory.
Used for initializing static variables of the class or performing any one-time setup tasks that need to happen before any objects of the class are created.
Can be multiple static blocks within a class, and they are executed in the order they appear in the code.

Q16. Different ways to load the .class file into memory:

The Java class loader is responsible for loading .class files into memory on demand. It's a complex mechanism, but in general, the class loader uses the classpath to locate the required .class file and then defines the class within the JVM.
There's no direct way for an application to explicitly load a .class file.
Q17. Calling a constructor in Java:

Constructors are invoked using the new keyword followed by the class name and parentheses (optionally containing arguments).
A constructor can't directly call another constructor within the same class, but it can use this() to call overloaded constructors within the same class.
Q18. Method recursion:
Method recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself directly or indirectly. This creates a nesting of method calls until a base case is reached, where the recursion stops.
Use recursion with caution to avoid stack overflow errors.

Q19. Calling static members in Java:
Static members (methods and variables) can be called directly using the class name followed by a dot (.) and the member name.
You can also access them through an object instance, but it's generally less efficient.

Q20. Switch vs. else-if statements:
Use switch statements for multi-way branching based on a single variable's value. It's efficient for a limited number of discrete cases.
Use else-if chains for more complex branching logic or when the conditions involve multiple variables.

Q21. for vs. while loops:
Use for loops when you know the exact number of iterations beforehand (e.g., iterating over an array).
Use while loops when you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance, or when the loop condition may change within the loop.

Q22. Accessing classes from other packages:
No, you cannot access classes from other packages without an import statement. This enforces encapsulation and prevents naming conflicts.

Q23. Normal vs. static import:
Normal import: Imports all members (classes, methods, variables) from a package. You need to prefix them with the package name when using them.
Static import: Imports only specific static members from a class. You can use them directly without the class name.

Q24. Modifiers applicable to constructors:
Constructors can have the same access specifiers as methods (public, protected, private), as well as default (package-private).

Q25. System.out.println():
A static method of the System.out class that prints a message to the console followed by a newline character.

Q26. Accessing sub-package data with import *:
No, importing a main package with * does not grant access to classes in sub-packages. You need to import them explicitly.

Q27. Permission/Scoping modifiers in Java:
Java uses access specifiers (public, protected, private, default) to control access to classes, methods, and variables. They define the scope of visibility.

Q28. Define inheritance? how many types inheritance in java?:
Inheritance is an OOP concept where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and polymorphism.
Java supports single inheritance (a subclass can only inherit from one direct superclass).

Q29. Explain about Object class in java?:
The root class of all classes in Java. It provides default methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode(). Most classes implicitly inherit from Object.

 
Q30. Define the Polymorphism? How many types of Polymorphisms in java?:
The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It's achieved through method overriding and overloading.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading): Occurs when methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines which method to call at compile time.
Runtime polymorphism (method overriding): Occurs when a subclass overrides a method inherited from its superclass. The actual method called depends on the object's type at runtime.


Q31. What are the Different types of overloading in java? What is the advantage? 
In Java, method overloading allows you to have multiple methods with the same name as long as their parameter lists differ. This creates methods for similar tasks but with different inputs.

Types:

By Number of Arguments: Methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters.
By Argument Types: Methods have the same name but different parameter types.
Advantages:

Readability: Makes code clearer for related tasks with different inputs.
Flexibility: Provides a user-friendly interface with choices based on data types.
Conciseness: Avoids code duplication by defining a base implementation and overloading for variations.

Q32. What is method Overriding? what is the advantage?
Method Overriding
Method overriding allows a subclass to inherit a method from its superclass but define its own implementation specific to the subclass. This is useful for customizing behavior based on the object's type.

Key Points:
Involves a method in the subclass with the same name, return type, and parameter list as a method in the superclass.
Subclass implementation (overridden method) can access the superclass implementation (overridden method) using super keyword.

Advantages:
Polymorphism: Enables runtime object behavior based on the actual object type (achieved through overriding).
Code Reusability: Leverages existing functionality from the superclass while providing specialized behavior in subclasses.
Flexibility: Allows subclasses to adapt inherited behavior to their specific needs.

Q33. What are the rules to fallow while overriding the method?
Here are the key rules to follow while overriding methods in Java:
Method Signature:
The method name, return type, and parameter list (number, order, and type of arguments) must be exactly the same in the subclass as in the superclass.

Access Modifier:
The access modifier of the overriding method cannot be more restrictive than the access modifier of the overridden method. In simpler terms:
If the superclass method is public, the overriding method can be public or protected, but not private.
If the superclass method is protected, the overriding method can be protected or public, but not private.
private methods cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Exceptions:
The overriding method can throw the same exception(s) or a subclass of the exception(s) thrown by the overridden method. It cannot throw a new or broader checked exception. Unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) are not restricted.

final and static Methods:
final methods cannot be overridden in subclasses, as they are meant to be final implementations.
static methods can technically be overridden, but it's generally considered bad practice as it hides the superclass method and can lead to confusion. It's better to create a new static method in the subclass if needed.
Remember: These rules ensure proper method overriding behavior and prevent unexpected issues in your Java code.

Q34. What is Co-variant return type in java?

In Java, covariant return types refer to a specific scenario when overriding methods in inheritance. Here's a breakdown for an interview:

Covariant Return Types
Covariant return types allow a subclass to return a type that is a subtype of the return type declared in the superclass method it's overriding. This provides more flexibility when working with inheritance hierarchies.

Key Points:
Applies only to non-primitive return types.
Subclass's return type must be a subtype of the superclass's return type (e.g., List<String> is a subtype of List<Object>).
Enables a subclass to return a more specific type that provides additional functionality or restricts the type of object returned.

Benefits:
Improved Type Safety: Ensures returned objects are compatible with the superclass type but potentially offer more specific functionality.
Flexibility: Allows subclasses to customize the return type based on their specific needs.
Example:
Java
class Animal {
    public Animal getBaby() {
        return new Animal(); // Superclass method
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public Puppy getBaby() { // Covariant return type (Puppy is a subtype of Animal)
        return new Puppy();
    }
}
Use code with caution.
In this example, Dog overrides getBaby and returns a Puppy object, which is a subtype of Animal. This allows for a more specific object to be returned while still maintaining compatibility with the superclass method signature.

Note: Covariant return types were introduced in Java 5.0 and can be a powerful tool for working with inheritance, but it's important to use them judiciously to maintain clarity and avoid potential confusion.

1. OOP Concepts

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and related operations (methods). Here are some fundamental OOP concepts:

Classes: Blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.
Objects: Instances of classes. They hold specific data values (attribute values) and can execute the methods defined in the class.
Inheritance: A mechanism for creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (superclasses). Subclasses can also add their own attributes and override inherited methods to provide specialized behavior.
Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) with the methods that operate on that data within a class. This protects data integrity and promotes modularity.
Polymorphism: The ability of objects to respond differently to the same message (method call). There are two types:
Static Polymorphism (Compile-Time Polymorphism): Achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments provided at compile time.
Dynamic Polymorphism (Run-Time Polymorphism): Achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a new implementation for a method inherited from its superclass. The actual method to be called is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type (dynamic dispatch).
Abstraction: Focusing on the essential details of an object's behavior without exposing implementation details. This can be achieved through interfaces (contracts that define methods without providing implementations) and abstract classes (classes that provide partial implementations and force subclasses to implement undefined methods).

2. Dynamic Dispatch and Static Calling in Polymorphism
Dynamic Dispatch (Run-Time Polymorphism):
Occurs when a method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object being referred to.
Achieved through method overriding in inheritance hierarchies.
Enables flexible behavior because the most appropriate method implementation is chosen based on the object's type at runtime.
Static Calling (Compile-Time Polymorphism):
Occurs when the method to be called is determined by the compiler at compile time based on the declared type of the reference variable.
Achieved through method overloading in the same class.
Useful for disambiguating methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

Feature		Dynamic Dispatch (Run-Time Polymorphism)	Static Calling (Compile-Time Polymorphism)
Resolution			Runtime							        Compile time
Inheritance			Required 								Not required (same class)
Mechanism			Method overriding						Method overloading
Flexibility			Higher									Lower

3. Different Types of Exceptions
Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of program execution. They signal unexpected conditions or errors that need to be handled. Here are common types of exceptions:
Checked Exceptions: Exceptions that the compiler forces the programmer to explicitly handle using a try-catch block or by declaring the method to throw the exception. Examples include IOException, FileNotFoundException, and SQLException. These exceptions typically represent external conditions that cannot be guaranteed not to happen during program execution.
Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions that the compiler does not enforce handling. Examples include NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and IndexOutOfBoundsException. These exceptions often indicate programming errors or unexpected internal conditions.
User-Defined Exceptions: Exceptions created by the programmer to signal specific errors or conditions in their code. This allows for more tailored exception handling.
By understanding and using these OOP concepts effectively, you can write more robust, maintainable, and flexible object-oriented programs.

7.multithreading questions?


1. Singleton Class in Java
Here's a well-structured singleton class implementation in Java using the lazy initialization approach:

Java
public class MySingleton {

    private static MySingleton instance;

    private MySingleton() {} // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation

    public static MySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (MySingleton.class) { // Thread-safe initialization
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new MySingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Your class methods and fields here
}

2. Multiple Inheritance in Java
Java directly supports single inheritance for classes. However, it allows multiple inheritance using interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting their methods and enforcing a contract:

Java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
}

interface Colorable {
    String getColor();
}

public class Circle implements Shape, Colorable {
    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        // ... calculate area
    }

    @Override
    public String getColor() {
        // ... return color
    }
}

3. Extending Class by Abstract Class and Interface
Yes, you can extend an abstract class and implement one or more interfaces simultaneously. This allows combining behavior from both:

Java
abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound();
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

public class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Chirp!");
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Soaring through the sky!");
    }
}
.
4. Java Coding Standard Tools
Several tools can help you check adherence to Java coding standards:
Checkstyle (https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/): Customizable checker for common coding styles.
PMD (https://pmd.sourceforge.io/): Wide range of rules for code quality and security.
SonarQube (https://www.sonarqube.org/): Comprehensive platform for code quality analysis, including style.
Your IDE's built-in formatting and style checkers: Many IDEs provide features to enforce formatting and style.

5. Multithreading Questions
Multithreading involves creating multiple threads of execution within a program. Here are some common topics to explore:
Thread creation: Thread class, Runnable interface, ExecutorService.
Synchronization: synchronized keyword, locks (Java 5+), semaphores (Java 5+).
Thread communication: wait(), notify(), notifyAll().
Thread safety: Ensuring data integrity when accessed by multiple threads.
Deadlocks: Preventing situations where threads wait indefinitely for each other.
Thread pools: Managing a pool of reusable threads for improved performance.
These are just starting points for multithreading. Consider researching these topics further and experimenting with code examples to deepen your understanding.

-----------
1. OOP Concepts and Real-Life Example
Object: A blueprint for entities with data (attributes) and actions (methods).
Class: Defines the structure of objects.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together within a class.
Inheritance: Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties from existing classes (parent classes).
Polymorphism: Objects of different classes responding to the same message in different ways.
Real-Life Example: Imagine a library. A Book class could represent a book object. Attributes might include title, author, ISBN, and genre. Methods could be borrow(), return(), and checkAvailability(). Multiple book objects (instances of the Book class) can exist, each with its unique information.

2. Final Keyword and Method Overriding
final keyword: Restricts modifications.
Classes: Prevents inheritance.
Methods: Stops overriding in subclasses.
Variables: Makes the value constant after assignment.
Why Not Override Final Methods (Real-Life Example):

Imagine a final class named GovernmentRegulation. A method calculateTaxRate() within it would be final, ensuring a consistent tax calculation across the system. Subclasses (e.g., StateTax or FederalTax) can't override this behavior, maintaining a unified tax calculation approach.

3. Method Overriding
Allows subclasses to redefine inherited methods from parent classes for specialized behavior.

Real-Life Example: Consider a Vehicle class with a startEngine() method that generically starts an engine. A subclass ElectricCar can override this method to provide an electric car-specific engine start sequence.

4. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) Phases
A structured process for software development:
Planning: Defining project requirements, scope, and feasibility.
Requirements Analysis: Detailing functional and non-functional needs.
Design: Creating blueprints for system architecture, data structures, and user interfaces.
Development: Building, coding, and testing individual software components.
Testing: Rigorously verifying system functionality and identifying defects.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Ongoing bug fixes, updates, and enhancements.
Real-Life Example: Building a library management system would follow these phases:

Identify user needs (borrowing, returning, searching)
Define data entities (books, users, loans)
Plan functionalities (search, borrow, return, overdue management)
Develop components (database, user interface, borrowing logic)
Test thoroughly (search accuracy, borrow/return functionality)
Deploy the system for librarian and user access
Maintain it (fix bugs, add new features as needed)
I hope this concise explanation is helpful!

Accenture:
----------
1. Interface
In programming, an interface defines a contract - a set of methods that a class or another interface must implement. It specifies the behavior that classes adhering to the interface must exhibit, promoting code flexibility and reusability.

2. Statement vs. Prepared Statement
Statement: A basic way to execute SQL queries. Statements are created dynamically, making them susceptible to SQL injection attacks where malicious code can be injected into the query.

Prepared Statement: A more secure approach. Prepared statements are pre-compiled, separating the SQL syntax from the data. Data is inserted using placeholders (?) and bound separately, preventing injection attacks.

3. Method Overriding
Method overriding allows a subclass to redefine the behavior of a method inherited from its parent class. The subclass provides its own implementation for the method, creating polymorphism (the ability of objects to respond differently to the same method call).

4. Immutable Class
An immutable class is an object whose state cannot be modified after it's created. Once initialized, its values cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety and simplifies reasoning about program behavior.

5. Current Projects
(I can't disclose details on current projects, but here are general project areas in software development)

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes that can be stored or transmitted. This allows objects to be persisted (saved) to a file or database and later deserialized (reconstructed) when needed.

7. Sorting an ArrayList
You can sort an ArrayList using the Collections.sort() method from the java.util package. This method takes a comparison object (a Comparator) that defines how elements should be compared for sorting. You can use built-in comparators like Comparable.naturalOrder() for natural ordering or create custom comparators for specific sorting criteria.

8. Sorting Employees by Age

Assuming Employee has an age property:

Java
ArrayList<Employee> employees = ...; // your employee list

Collections.sort(employees, new Comparator<Employee>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
        return Integer.compare(e1.getAge(), e2.getAge());
    }
});

9. Max Salary Query
The specific query depends on your database system, but generally, it would be:

SQL
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee_table;
Use code with caution.
Replace employee_table with the actual name of your table and salary with the salary column name.

10. Singleton Class
Here's a basic example of a singleton class in Java:

Java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
This ensures only one instance of the class can exist.

11. Unique Records using Collection
Here are two approaches:

Set: Sets don't allow duplicates. You can convert your list to a HashSet and then back to a List (if needed) to get unique elements.
Custom Logic: Iterate through the list, checking if each element already exists using a separate data structure (e.g., another set or a hash map).

12. String Pool (Conceptual Explanation)
The string pool is a memory optimization technique in Java. String literals (text directly written in code) are stored in a central pool to avoid creating duplicate String objects for the same content. This saves memory, especially for frequently used strings.

Delloite:
-----------
1. Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming

Procedural Programming (POP):
Focuses on breaking down a problem into a sequence of steps (procedures/functions).
Data is often global or passed between functions.
Less emphasis on data security and reusability.
Examples: C, Fortran, BASIC.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
Objects interact with each other through messages.
Promotes data hiding (encapsulation) and code reusability (inheritance, polymorphism).
Better models real-world entities.
Examples: Java, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript (with some limitations).

2. OOP Concepts
Object: An instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with attributes and methods.
Class: A blueprint that defines properties (attributes) and actions (methods) for objects.
Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods within objects, controlling access through modifiers (public, private, protected).
Inheritance: Allows creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and methods from existing classes (superclasses), promoting code reusability.
Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can respond differently to the same message, enabling flexible behavior.
Abstraction: Exposes essential details while hiding implementation complexities.

3. Abstraction vs. Encapsulation
Abstraction: Focuses on providing a simplified view of an object's functionality, hiding implementation details. It's a broader concept.
Example: Using a car class, users interact with methods like accelerate() and brake() without needing to know the engine mechanics.
Encapsulation: Deals with how data and methods are bundled within an object, controlling access through modifiers. It's a mechanism to implement abstraction.
Example: Private attributes in a car class prevent direct modification from outside, promoting data security.

4. Abstraction vs. Abstract Class
Abstraction: Is a concept, not a specific language construct. It's about providing a simplified view of functionality.
Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated directly but serves as a blueprint for subclasses. It defines abstract methods that subclasses must implement. It's a tool to enforce abstraction by leaving some implementation details incomplete.
Example: An abstract class Shape might have an abstract method getArea() that subclasses like Circle and Square implement to provide specific area calculations.

5. Abstraction vs. Interface
Abstraction: As mentioned, is a concept about simplified views.
Interface: A contract that specifies what methods an object must implement without providing any implementation details. It promotes loose coupling and code reusability.
Example: An interface Drawable might define a method draw() without saying how to draw, allowing different objects like Circle and Square to implement their drawing logic.

6. Multiple Inheritance in Java
Java doesn't directly support multiple inheritance (inheriting from more than one concrete class) due to ambiguity issues (the "diamond problem").
Alternatives:
Use interfaces for code reusability and multiple contracts.
Consider using mixins (a design pattern to share code across unrelated classes).

7. Multiple Inheritance with Abstract Class
You cannot directly achieve multiple inheritance with concrete classes in Java.
Abstract classes can be used in a hierarchy inheritance structure, where a subclass inherits from multiple abstract classes.
This provides some benefits of multiple inheritance but doesn't fully replicate it.

8. JDBC Connection in Java
Java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class JdbcConnectionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Replace with your database connection details
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
        String username = "your_username";
        String password = "your_password";

        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"); // Load the JDBC driver
        Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

        if (connection != null) {
            System.out.println("Connection established successfully!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Connection failed!");
        }

        // Perform database operations here (e.g., using PreparedStatement, etc.)

        connection.close(); // Close the connection
    }
	
9. **How HashMap Internally Works**
HashMaps in Java (and many other languages) leverage hashing for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

* **Hash Function:**
    - Takes a key (object) and calculates a unique integer value (hash code).
    - Ideally, different keys should map to different hash codes (collision avoidance).
    - Java's `hashCode()` method is used by default for keys.
* **Array (Hash Table):**
    - Stores key-value pairs.
    - Each element in the array is a bucket (or bin) that can hold one or more key-value pairs (depending on implementation).
* **Linked Lists (Optional):**
    - To handle collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same bucket), some HashMap implementations use linked lists to chain these key-value pairs within the same bucket.
* **`equals()` Method:**
    - Used for key comparison during insertion and retrieval.
    - Ensures you're comparing for actual data equality, not just object reference equality.
**Steps for Insertion:**

1. Calculate the hash code for the key.
2. Use the hash code to determine the index (bucket) in the array.
3. If the bucket is empty, insert the key-value pair directly there.
4. If the bucket already contains an element, check if the keys are equal using the `equals()` method:
    - If equal, update the value associated with the key.
    - If not equal (collision), use a linked list (if implemented) to chain the new key-value pair to the existing elements in the bucket.

**Steps for Retrieval:**

1. Calculate the hash code for the key.
2. Use the hash code to determine the index (bucket) in the array.
3. Search the bucket (possibly a linked list if collisions occurred) for the key using the `equals()` method.
4. If the key is found, return the associated value.
5. If the key is not found, return `null`.

10. Code to Retrieve Elements from Hashtable
While Java's `HashMap` is more commonly used, `Hashtable` offers similar functionality. Here's how to retrieve elements:

```java
import java.util.Hashtable;

public class HashtableRetrievalExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hashtable<String, Integer> phoneBook = new Hashtable<>();
        phoneBook.put("Alice", 123456);
        phoneBook.put("Bob", 789012);

        Integer aliceNumber = phoneBook.get("Alice");
        if (aliceNumber != null) {
            System.out.println("Alice's number: " + aliceNumber);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Alice not found in the phone book.");
        }
    }
}
```

11. ArrayList vs. Vector

Both `ArrayList` and `Vector` are dynamic arrays in Java, but they have some key differences:

* **Thread Safety:**
    - `ArrayList` is non-synchronized, meaning it's not thread-safe for concurrent access.
    - `Vector` is synchronized, making it thread-safe but with potential performance overhead.
* **Legacy:**
    - `ArrayList` is generally preferred for most modern Java applications.
    - `Vector` is a legacy class that might be used in older codebases, but it's not recommended for new development due to performance implications of synchronization.

12. Synchronization

Synchronization in Java ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource (object or data) at a time. This prevents race conditions and data corruption when multiple threads try to modify the same data concurrently. Common synchronization mechanisms include:

* **Synchronized methods/blocks:**
    - Use the `synchronized` keyword with methods or code blocks to control access.
* **Semaphores:**
    - Control access using permits, allowing a specific number of threads to access the resource at once.
* **Locks (Java 5 and above):**
    - Provide more granular control for synchronization.

13. IBM WebSphere

- **WebSphere** is an **application server**, not a web server.
- It provides a platform for building, deploying, and managing enterprise applications.
- **Key features:**
    - Java EE (Enterprise Edition) compliance
    - Web services support (SOAP, REST)
    - Security features (authentication, authorization)
    - Scalability and clustering capabilities
- **Use cases:**
    - Deploying complex Java applications
    - Integrating with various back-end systems (databases, legacy systems)
    - Providing high availability and scalability
	
14.Web Server vs. Application Server: Interview Answer
Both web servers and application servers play crucial roles in delivering web applications, but they handle different functionalities:
Web Server: Acts as a front-end door, serving static content (HTML, images, etc.) and dynamic content generated by scripting languages. It primarily uses HTTP for communication and focuses on content delivery.
Application Server: Functions as the back-end engine, handling complex business logic, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content based on application rules. It supports various protocols (HTTP, SOAP, REST) and offers robust security features.
Here's an analogy:

Web Server: Like a storefront, it showcases and delivers pre-made products (static content) with basic order adjustments (dynamic content).
Application Server: Think of it as the warehouse and production team, handling order processing, inventory management (databases), and custom product creation (business logic).
When to Choose Which:

Use a web server for simple websites with static content or basic dynamic needs.
Opt for an application server for complex applications requiring business logic execution, database interaction, and advanced security.
Highlighting Your Knowledge:

If applicable, mention specific web server and application server examples (Apache, Nginx, WebSphere, JBoss).
Briefly touch upon concepts like scalability (web servers scale horizontally, application servers can scale both horizontally and vertically).
Emphasize how understanding these distinctions helps you choose the right technology for different application scenarios.

Synechron for UBS:
---------------------
1. OOP Principles and Abstraction:**

- **OOP Principles:**
    - **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (operations) that manipulate that data within a class. This protects data integrity by controlling access.
    - **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses), promoting code reusability and maintainability.
    - **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways (method overriding). This allows for flexible and dynamic behavior.
    - **Abstraction:** Focusing on the essential features and behaviors of objects, hiding implementation details from the user. This simplifies code interaction and promotes loose coupling.

- **Abstraction:** The process of defining what an object can do without revealing how it does it. Interfaces and abstract classes are tools to achieve abstraction in Java.

- **Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes (Pre-Java 8):**

  - **Abstract Classes:**
    - Can have abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
    - A class can only inherit from one abstract class directly (single inheritance).
  - **Interfaces:**
    - Can only have abstract methods, no implementation.
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance).

**Why Interfaces Are Still Needed (Even with Abstract Classes):**

- Interfaces provide a purely behavioral contract, focusing solely on what needs to be done.
- They enable loose coupling, as classes implementing an interface can change without affecting other parts that rely on the interface's methods.
- Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces, offering more flexibility but not replacing the core purpose of interfaces.

2. Composition and Aggregation:

- **Composition:** A strong "has-a" relationship where the lifetime of the part (composed object) depends on the whole (containing object). If the whole object is destroyed, the composed object is also destroyed. Example: A `Car` has an `Engine` as a part.
- **Aggregation:** A weaker "has-a" relationship where the part (aggregated object) can exist independently of the whole. Destroying the whole object might not necessarily destroy the aggregated object. Example: A `University` has `Departments` as aggregates. A department could potentially exist outside of a specific university.

3. Indexing in SQL:

- A data structure associated with a table column that improves the speed of data retrieval based on specific search criteria.
- **Types of Indexes:**
    - **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring data integrity and enforcing uniqueness.
    - **Unique:** Ensures no duplicate values in a column.
    - **Foreign Key:** References a primary key in another table, enforcing relationships between tables.
    - **Secondary Index:** Improves query performance by speeding up searches based on frequently used columns.

4. ConcurrentHashMap vs. HashMap:

- **ConcurrentHashMap:**
    - Thread-safe, suitable for concurrent access by multiple threads.
    - Uses internal locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption during concurrent operations.
    - Slower performance compared to `HashMap` due to overhead for locking.
- **HashMap:**
    - Not thread-safe, data corruption can occur if accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
    - Faster performance than `ConcurrentHashMap` for single-threaded or properly synchronized access.
- **LinkedHashMap:**
    - Maintains the insertion order of elements.
    - Useful when the order of elements is important.
    - Slower performance than `HashMap` due to the overhead of maintaining order.

5. Return in Try and Finally:

- **Try Block:** Code that might throw an exception.
- **Finally Block:** Always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
    - If a `return` statement is executed within the `try` block and no exception is thrown, that value is returned.
    - If a `return` statement is executed within the `finally` block:
        - The `finally` block's `return` value takes precedence, even if a `return` statement was previously executed in the `try` block.
    - If an exception is thrown, any `return` statements in the `try` or `finally` block are ignored. The exception is propagated to the calling code.

6. Design Patterns and Singleton:

- **Design Patterns:** Reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a general blueprint that can be adapted to specific contexts.
- **Singleton Design Pattern:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. It's useful for resource management (e.g., a logging service


7. Custom Exceptions
- In Java, exceptions are classes that inherit from the `Exception` class.
- You can create custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or a more specific subclass like `RuntimeException`.
- Override the constructor(s) of the `Exception` class to provide additional information about the custom exception.

**Example:**

```java
public class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

8. ClassNotFoundException vs. NoClassDefFoundError:

- **ClassNotFoundException:** Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot find the bytecode for a specific class. This usually happens when the class is not included in the classpath.
- **NoClassDefFoundError:** Thrown when the JVM has successfully loaded a class but cannot find the bytecode for another class that the first class depends on. This typically occurs at runtime when a class references another class that wasn't loaded correctly.

9. Synchronized vs. Lock:

- **Synchronized:** A keyword in Java that provides a mutual exclusion mechanism for controlling access to a shared resource. Only one thread can acquire the lock at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
- **Lock:** An interface in Java's `java.util.concurrent` package that offers more fine-grained control over synchronization compared to the `synchronized` keyword. Different lock implementations provide varying levels of fairness and performance characteristics.

10. notify() vs. notifyAll():

- **notify():** Signals a single waiting thread that it's okay to resume execution.
- **notifyAll():** Signals all waiting threads that they can resume execution.

**Why `notify()` is Still Needed:**

- `notifyAll()` can be disruptive, as all threads might wake up and try to acquire the same resource, potentially leading to contention.
- `notify()` can be used for more controlled wake-up behavior, allowing specific threads to proceed.

11. Read-Write Lock in Java:

- A type of lock that allows concurrent read and write access to a shared resource under certain conditions:
    - Multiple threads can acquire a read lock simultaneously as long as no thread holds a write lock.
    - Only one thread can acquire a write lock at a time, and no read locks can be granted while a write lock is held.
- This is useful for scenarios where read operations are much more frequent than write operations, improving concurrency and throughput.
- The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides implementations like `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.

12. ReentrantLock:

- A type of lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread without throwing an exception.
- Useful for situations where a thread might need to acquire the same lock recursively within its code.
- Implemented in the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.

13. Producer-Consumer Model and Blocking Queue:

- **Producer-Consumer Model:** A concurrency pattern where one or more producers create data (products) and place it in a shared buffer, while one or more consumers remove data from the buffer and process it.
- **Blocking Queue:** A thread-safe queue that blocks producers when the queue is full and consumers when the queue is empty. This ensures safe and efficient data exchange between producers and consumers.
- Java's `java.util.concurrent` package provides implementations like `BlockingQueue`.

14. CountdownLatch and CyclicBarrier:

- **CountDownLatch:** A synchronization tool that allows a set of threads to wait for a certain number of events to occur before all threads can proceed.
- **CyclicBarrier:** A synchronization tool similar to `CountDownLatch` but allows a fixed number of waiting threads to proceed together after a set number of events have occurred. It can be reused multiple times unlike `CountDownLatch`.
- Both are useful for coordinating threads and ensuring they reach a specific point before continuing.

15. Java Features (Optional):

- Java Features (often referred to as "JEP"s - Java Enhancement Proposals) are official additions to the Java language introduced in new versions. These features aim to improve the language's capabilities, usability, and performance.
- Some examples of recent features (as of July 2024) include:
    - Records (Java 14): Lightweight data holders similar to classes.
    - Sealed Classes (Java 17): Restrict which classes can inherit from a sealed class.
    - Pattern Matching (preview in Java 17): More concise and readable way to perform pattern matching on objects.

16. SOLID Principles:
**SOLID** is an acronym for five key principles of object-oriented design that promote code that is:

  - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)
  - **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles help you write code that is:

  - **Maintainable:** Easier to understand, modify, and extend.
  - **Flexible:** Adaptable to changing requirements.
  - **Reusable:** Components can be reused in different parts of your application.
  - **Testable:** Individual units of code can be easily tested.

Let's delve into each principle:

**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**

- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- This means focusing each class on a specific functionality.
- Benefits: Reduces complexity, improves testability, and makes code easier to understand.

**2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**

- Software entities (classes, modules) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- This means you should be able to extend existing functionality without modifying the existing code.
- Achieved through techniques like inheritance and interfaces.

**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**

- Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
- If you have a piece of code that works with a base class, it should also work correctly with any subclass of that base class.
- Ensures consistency and reliability in your code.

**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**

- Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- Create smaller, specific interfaces instead of large, general-purpose interfaces.
- Improves code flexibility and reduces coupling.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions (interfaces) should not depend on details. Details (implementations) should depend on abstractions.
- Promotes loose coupling and makes code easier to test and maintain.

TIVITI:
------
1. Volatile Keywords and Thread Safety:
   - **Volatile:** The `volatile` keyword is used in programming languages like C, C++, Java, and C# to indicate that a variable's value can be modified by different threads or external factors (like hardware) at any time. This prevents the compiler from applying optimizations that might assume the value remains constant, ensuring the program always reads the latest value from memory.

   - **Thread Safety:** Thread safety refers to the ability of a program to function correctly when multiple threads (independent units of execution) access shared data concurrently. Without proper synchronization mechanisms, concurrent access can lead to race conditions, data corruption, or unpredictable behavior.

   - **Volatile and Thread Safety:** While `volatile` ensures the program reads the latest value, it doesn't guarantee thread safety on its own. It simply instructs the compiler not to cache the variable's value. You still need synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or atomic operations to control access to shared data and prevent race conditions.

2. Final Keywords:
   - The `final` keyword is used in various languages (Java, C++, C#) to declare variables or methods that cannot be changed after initialization. This helps prevent accidental modifications and improves code readability and maintainability.

   - **Thread Safety with final:** Declaring a variable as `final` doesn't inherently make it thread-safe. If the variable itself is an object, its internal state could still be modified by multiple threads, leading to issues. To ensure thread safety, use synchronization when modifying the object's internal state.

3. Multithreading-Related Questions:
   - **Thread Creation and Synchronization:** This covers how to create threads, manage their lifecycles, and use techniques like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables to synchronize access to shared data.
   - **Deadlocks and Livelocks:** These are common pitfalls in multithreading where threads become stuck waiting for resources from each other. Understanding how to avoid them is crucial.
   - **Thread Pools:** Thread pools manage a pool of pre-created threads that can be reused for tasks, improving performance compared to constantly creating and destroying threads.

4. Message Read from MQ (Message Queue):
   - Message queues (MQs) are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) that allows applications to send and receive messages asynchronously (without waiting for a response). These messages are typically stored in a queue until a receiving application retrieves them.

   - **Reading Messages:** The specific way to read messages from an MQ depends on the chosen technology (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Apache ActiveMQ). Generally, you'll use a client library provided by the MQ platform to connect to the queue and retrieve messages using methods like `receive` or `dequeue`.

5. Success and Failure Return in MQ:
   - MQs typically don't have a built-in mechanism to explicitly return success or failure for individual message deliveries. However, you can implement different strategies:

     - **Acknowledgements (Acks):** Some MQs support acknowledgements (acks). The receiving application sends an ack after successfully processing a message, indicating to the MQ that the message can be removed from the queue.
     - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in your application to catch exceptions or failed operations during message processing. You might retry failed messages or log errors for monitoring.
     - **Poison Queues:** In some cases, you might consider using a "poison queue" to store messages that consistently fail processing. This allows you to handle these problematic messages separately.



Synechron Morgan Stanley:
-------------------------
1. SQL Clauses:

SQL clauses are building blocks that form a complete SQL statement. They specify different parts of the operation you want to perform on a database table. Here are the main clauses:

- **SELECT Clause:** Used to retrieve data from tables. It specifies which columns you want to select.
- **FROM Clause:** Indicates the table(s) from which data will be retrieved.
- **WHERE Clause:** Filters the rows returned by the SELECT clause based on a condition.
- **GROUP BY Clause:** Groups rows with matching values in a specified column for aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG).
- **HAVING Clause:** Filters groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on a condition applied to aggregate functions.
- **ORDER BY Clause:** Sorts the result set based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.
- **JOIN Clauses:** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) Combine data from multiple tables based on a related column.
- **UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT:** Combine result sets of multiple SELECT statements in various ways.

2. Returning from `run()` and Callables:
- **`run()` Method:** In Java's `Thread` class, `run()` is the method that defines the code executed by the thread. However, `run()` doesn't explicitly return anything. To return a value from a thread, you can:
    - Use a class variable or shared data structure that the thread modifies.
    - Create a `Callable` object that implements the `call()` method, which can return a value. Submit the `Callable` to an `ExecutorService` and use `Future` to get the result.

- **Callables:** These are objects that implement the `java.util.concurrent.Callable` interface. They have a `call()` method that can return a result and may throw exceptions. You can use callables with `ExecutorService` to execute tasks that return values.

3. Singletons and Multithreading:
- **Singleton Pattern:** A design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it. It's achieved using a static member variable, a private constructor, and a public `getInstance()` method (or similar).

- **Singletons and Multithreading:** Singletons can be used in multithreaded environments, but proper synchronization is crucial to avoid race conditions where multiple threads try to access or create the instance simultaneously. Use synchronized access to the `getInstance()` method or a thread-safe initialization mechanism (e.g., double-checked locking with proper memory barriers).

4. Even-Odd Thread Printing (Java):
Here's a Java program using wait-notify to achieve even-odd thread printing:

```java
public class EvenOdd {
    private int count = 1;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    public void printEven() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            while (count % 2 != 0) {
                try {
                    lock.wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            System.out.println(count);
            count++;
            lock.notify();
        }
    }

    public void printOdd() {
        synchronized (lock) {


(Continuation of Even-Odd Thread Printing)

```java
        while (count % 2 == 0) {
            try {
                lock.wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
        count++;
        lock.notify();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EvenOdd eo = new EvenOdd();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(eo::printEven);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(eo::printOdd);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `count` keeps track of the current number.
- `lock` is an object used for synchronization.
- `printEven()` checks if `count` is odd. If so, it waits on the `lock`. Otherwise, it prints the even number, increments `count`, and notifies the other thread.
- `printOdd()` follows the opposite logic of checking for even `count` and notifying the even thread when printing odd.

This code ensures that only one thread prints at a time, resulting in an alternating even-odd sequence.

5. Clauses in Oracle (Similar to Standard SQL):
Oracle adheres to the standard SQL clauses mentioned earlier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)). There might be some syntax variations or additional features specific to Oracle.

6. CopyOnWriteArrayList:
`CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe implementation of `ArrayList` from the `java.util.concurrent` package. It creates a copy of the underlying array before modifying it, ensuring that modifications don't affect iterating threads. However, it can be slower for write-heavy scenarios due to copying.

7. String Palindrome with Best Case:
The best-case time complexity for checking if a string is a palindrome is O(n/2), where n is the string length. This can be achieved using two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, moving inward and comparing characters. If all characters match, it's a palindrome.

8. ArrayList and LinkedList:
 **ArrayList:** An array-based implementation with random access (efficient for accessing elements by index) but less efficient for insertions/deletions in the middle (requires shifting elements). It uses a fixed-size array that might need to be resized when capacity is exceeded.
- **LinkedList:** A node-based implementation with efficient insertions/deletions in the middle (only need to update references between nodes). It's less efficient for random access (requires traversing nodes to reach a specific index).

9. Protected Methods in Object Class:
The `Object` class defines several protected methods, including:

- `finalize()`: Called by the garbage collector before object is reclaimed. Generally discouraged to use directly, as it doesn't guarantee specific timing.
- `clone()`: Creates a shallow copy of the object. Subclasses can override it for deep copying if needed. It's marked protected to allow controlled access and avoid unintended side effects.

These methods are intended for internal use by subclasses of `Object` and are not generally meant for client code to call directly.

10. Locks in Multithreading:
Locks (or synchronizers) are mechanisms to control access to shared resources in multithreaded environments. They ensure that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing race conditions.

- **Reentrant Lock:** A type of lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread. It keeps track of the acquisition count and allows release only by the thread that acquired it the same number of times. This prevents deadlocks where a thread waits for a lock it already holds.

11. Design Patterns in Java:
Here are some common design patterns in Java:

- **Singleton:** Guarantees a single instance of a class.
- **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying their exact type (promoting loose coupling).
- **Adapter:** Makes incompatible interfaces work together.
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes to one object notify dependent objects.
- **Strategy:** Allows choosing an algorithm at runtime.
- **Template Method:** Defines the skeleton of an operation, allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.
- **Decorator:** Adds behavior to an object dynamically without changing its subclass.
